# minesweeper-python

This is a simple minesweeper game program written in Python using tkinter for the windows GUI functionality.  Since I'm using an Ubuntu shell with WSL the straight DISPLAY would not work.  I am using a program called MobaXterm in order to make the tkinter work the way it should.

I have completed the MVP with hardcoding a 6x6 grid and 9 bombs.  The program will show you a message box if you win or lose and then end.

Additional features will be dynamic game sizing, dynamic bomb amount, option to restart on win or lose and better visuals.
